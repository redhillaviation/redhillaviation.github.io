The Multi Engine Piston rating takes you to a whole new level of flying. Truly international destinations become very real prospects for a short weekend away or that event that you've always wanted to attend in Vienna or Rome. This course will train you to operate a multi-engine aircraft safely in all configurations and to manage the powerplants efficiently and effectively.
