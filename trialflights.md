The air experience package consists of a short pre-flight briefing conducted in the classroom, or the aircraft, followed by a 30 or 60 minute introductory flying session with one of our qualified flight instructors. In either case you will get a chance both to fly the aircraft and to enjoy the view.

    <div class="experience-title">Aerobatics Experience</div>
    The aerobatics experiences are the ultimate thrill for those with a sense of adventure, or friends and family with a mean streak.
    The 30 minute aerobatics experience is flown with a qualified aerobatics instructor in our Cessna 152 Aerobat. Enjoy the exhilaration of looping the loop, a barrel roll, a stall turn and a spin then back to boast about it to friends and family.
    The 60 minute aerobatic special is a combination of the introductory flying lesson with the thrill of the aerobatic experience.

<div id="landaway" class="experience">
    <div class="experience-title">A flight to another airfield and back</div>
    This experience consists of a flight, landing away at another airfield and then returning to Redhill.
    As with all trial lessons, we brief you first and you have the chance to fly the aircraft but with the added bonus of being able to experience a landing at another airfield.
    This is ideal for those looking to do something a little different or (four seater aircraft only) those who whis the share the fun (or cost) with friends/family.
